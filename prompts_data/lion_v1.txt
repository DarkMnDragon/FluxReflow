Andrea overwhelmed and surrounded by a swarm of silver jack fish during an exploration dive in Cabo Pulmo National Park, Mexico. <br /> <br /> Cabo Pulmo is the best example of a recovered reef in Mexican seas. A few years ago the fisherman of  Cabo Pulmo fished all the reef to the point that fishing stopped being a way to sustain their households and life in the reef was obliterated. So they decided to totally stop fishing and few years latter the reef recovered to an astonishing level, and it is today the best example of what the Sea of Cortes used to be like. <br /> <br /> Cabo Pulmo is a unique example of the power of preserving marine hot spots, or what Sylvia Earle calls Hope Spots; by selecting and protecting strategic marine areas, the biomass of the ocean can increase rapidly and improve the overall health of the oceans.

I liked this pleasing curve in the Merced River with El Capitan looming in the distance, so I returned when there was lots of mist, showing how tall El Cap really is! A 30-second exposure smoothed out the flowing water to show how peaceful it felt on this misty afternoon.  I won't mention about how I had to hang off of the edge of a burned stump for a half-hour to get this open view.  It took a while to get the soot off my hands!

"Getting Wet Under The Pier on Flickr.Via Flickr: I am honored to have done an interview and be the featured photographer on TIA International Photography's Blog today. Being a night shooter, I found a lot of Tosin's work very intriguing and inspiring. Tosin is the owner and photographer of TIA. After a few exchanges over facebook I ended up doing an interview for his blog. It will be the first interview I have done on my photography, so it was interesting to talk about my photos and experiences. Tosin, who I actually met up with a month back in San Francisco to go shoot, when he visited, is one of the nicest guys and an awesome photographer.  It was a pleasure, only though we got fogged in on our shoot. I am humbled about all of the nice things he has said about me in his interview. About this photo below. One of the questions he asked was about my favorite photo. This was the one I choose and you can read about it in the interview here:  blog.tia-international-photography.com/2012/07/09/feature… December 9, 2011 Canon 7D EF 17-40mm f/4L This print is for sale on my site.

Imagine, if you will, walking along a misty frozen swamp just after sunrise, surrounded by snow capped peaks. Occasionally the silence is broken by the call of black swans as the establish they're presence in the valley. This is not a fiction of my imagination, this is the scene at Glenorchy this morning. As I was immersed in this magical landscape I couldn't help but wonder how such a place could exist in our modern world. But it does, right here on the southern island of New Zealand.

Just a short drive from the city of Denver is Colorado's spectacular Rocky Mountain National Park, which 'encompasses 415 square miles of spectacular mountain environments'. Within the park's boundaries, the NPS says there are 77 mountain peaks over 12,000ft high. The highest is Longs Peak, which stands at 14,259ft (4,346m). Meanwhile, in the shadow of the mountains, National Geographic notes there are 'wild rivers, placid alpine lakes, and an amazing array of flora and fauna'. Pictured here is the park's Lake Helene - a stunning mountain lake at 10,643ft that is a popular spot with hikers

"A Razor to the Sky As is the case with every day here, I have also included a photo.  This is of the indomitable Fitz Roy at sunrise buried deep in the Andes, in the hinterland between Argentina and Chile.  To get this shot, it was none too easy!  First, I ""woke"" up after a sleepless night in a two-man tent with Yuri.  It was perhaps the worst night of my life and I've never had a panic attack before, but I honestly felt like I was pretty close.  The smell combined with the pitch black, the snoring, the freezing cold, and the tiny tent was almost more than I could bear!I woke up around 4:30 AM with -7 Celsius temperatures.  It was bitter cold.  I got dressed QUICKLY in the pitch black cold and then headed off with two of my Russian friends to begin scaling the mountain.  They had lights on their hats;  I did not.  I walked between them, trying not to slip on the icy ""trail"" between the dodging shadows cast by their headlights.  I'll never forget it for the rest of my life.  We ascended 1,500 feet in less than 45 minutes so we could catch the pink rays of sunrise just as they hit the peaks.Last, I have been interviewed about photography and more on the Pro Photo Show.  It's a free podcast that you can listen to if you want to know more about the process or just hear me ramble on about stuff you may or may not find interesting!- Trey RatcliffClick here to read the rest of this post at the Stuck in Customs blog."

28 AUGUST 2015 - BANGKOK, THAILAND: A woman gets ready to close her shop early on Hungry Ghost Day in Bangkok's Chinatown. Mahayana  Buddhists believe that the gates of hell are opened on the full moon of the seventh lunar month of the Chinese calendar, and the spirits of hungry ghosts allowed to roam the earth. These ghosts need food and merit to find their way back to their own. People help by offering food, paper money, candles and flowers, making merit of their own in the process. Hungry Ghost Day is observed in communities with a large ethnic Chinese population, like Bangkok's Chinatown.     PHOTO BY JACK KURTZ

Bill Case, with eight kills, was the third-highest scoring Black Sheep member. He is famous for cheating death on his last combat mission when for  reasons unexplained he decided to lower his Corsair's seat a notch (the only time he ever did so). In battle, a Japanese Zero fighter's bullet smashed into the cockpit, bloodying his scalp. If he had been sitting an inch higher, the bullet would have killed him. William Case survived and lived for another 52 years, passing away in 1995.

Birds behaviour winner: Land of the Eagle by Audun Rikardsen, Norway. High on a ledge, on the coast near his home in northern Norway, Rikardsen carefully positioned an old tree branch that he hoped would make a perfect golden eagle lookout. To this, he bolted a tripod head with a camera, flashes and motion sensor attached, and built himself a hide a short distance away. From time to time, he left road‑kill carrion nearby. Very gradually – over the next three years – a golden eagle got used to the camera and started to use the branch regularly to survey the coast below.

womenreading:  Gravin de Pagès, née de Cornellan, as St. Catherine (1820-1850)  Joseph-Désiré Court (1797-1865). Romanticism. Portrait. Oil on canvas. Rijksmuseum. Amsterdam, Netherlands. Court, a painter of historical subjects and portraits, was a pupil at the École des Beaux-Arts under Gros. There were high expectations when he exhibited in 1827 'The Death of Caesar,' a work manifesting earnest thought, and a conscientious handling of the facts of history. This is now preserved in the Louvre. Having shown himself in this and other works a vigorous painter, capable of seizing a subject with a masterly grasp, Court eventually dissipated his talents in the production of a series of empty official pictures painted by order of Louis Philippe.

Coachella Dawn - Driving to the Indian Palm Canyons early one morning at dawn, I discovered an even more beautiful vista in the stark desert landscape around me. The gray and brown mountains and palms lit up suddenly in the first morning light, reflecting a glorious celebration of color that lasted about 20 minutes, until the sun hit the valley floor and the color washed away into the mid-morning.
Large turquoise lake sits at the bottom of forested valley surrounded by majestic mountains lit by evening sun.

It had been overcast and drizzling all day long, but I set up my camera anyways just before sunset time, just in case.  Sure enough, I started noticing hints of warmer light on the peaks, and within five minutes, the sun dropped into a gap between the thick cloud cover and horizon, lighting up the peaks like a fiery spotlight.  It was some of the most amazing light I've ever witnessed.

Steps of Girona - Spain Thomas W Schaller - Watercolor Fabriano Artistic Paper, 140 lb. The final studio piece was derived almost in full from my site sketch rather than from reference photos. I followed the lead of the sketch to show only the essential elements in the work - the strong and dynamic range of deep,luminous darks, to the saved white paper of the highest lights. And the sense of warm, reflected sunlight - illuminating even the deep arch and cornice - was suggested by the use of complementary color - primarily in the blue / orange range.

Wall Art - Painting - Sunny Side Of The Street 30 X 40 - Sold by Michael Swanson
"""Valley of Enchantment"" Location: Valley View, Yosemite National Park, California.   Yosemite is arguably the most beautiful national park in the world. I feel very privileged that I stay close to Yosemite and can visit it anytime with a couple of hours drive. The proximity to the park has allowed me to visit it practically in every season. The view captured here is during spring season when the water in the Merced river is high and rapids are in full force. Spring is also the season of waterfalls and you can see that the Bridalveil falls on the right and Ribbontail falls on the left are also flowing at their peak. The waterfalls reach their peak flow due of all the snowmelt at higher elevation.  The beauty in the valley does not end with flows in Merced river and waterfalls alone. The meadows start turning green and bring out a lush green color in the park that is in very good contrast with the warm tones of the granite peaks during evening hours. And when all of this is combined with presence of some clouds in the sky and penetrating light through the pockets in those clouds, you can get very dramatic views in the valley. I happened to catch all of these on the day I shot this image. Though I am very happy with how the image turned out I can't forget that seeing this beauty in person was an altogether different experience. I am glad I could bring back some of that in this image.   Tech Info: Lens: Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L @ 24mm Camera: Canon EOS 5D Mk II Exposure: 1.6sec at f/14 and ISO 100 Filters: Hoya 8-stop solid ND filter along with LEE 0.9 (3-stop) soft edge ND Grad filter  Yosemite is the arguably the most beautiful national park. It's grandeur and the time scale it took to evolve is very humbling. I learnt that the granite peaks started out as molten magma deep below the earth's surface about 100 million years ago. Merced river then carved it into a ""V"" shaped valley and finally glaciers shaped it into its present day ""U"" shape. The beauty of the valley has inspired many. It's lush forests, tall granite peaks, amazing monoliths and beautiful waterfalls are so pristine that a visit to the park often overwhelms the senses. A visit here at least once in lifetime is a must."

VALERY IN HIS STUDIO - Moscow, Russia  A fire burnt Valery Vrady's art studio to the ground in April, 1995.  While Valery himself was not physically injured, about 2000 of his paintings and drawings were destroyed in the blaze.   Nearly his entire collection of work, thirty years in the making, was gone.  I can only imagine how heartbroken he must have been.  If I lost all my hard drives, along with whatever photos I had stored on the internet, I'd weep: and not a cool movie cry where my eyes would well up and a single tear would roll slowly down my cheek, glistening in the sun.   I'm talking heaving sobs, ugly face contortions, and slobber and snot galore.  I'm not sure how long it would take me to pick up my camera again.  There's a chance that it would be a while.  I hope I never have to find out.  After the fire, Valery wasted little time before picking up a brush and getting back to work.  Two decades later, I arrived at a charity event hosted at his combined studio and home in central Moscow, unaware of the fire or even who Valery Vrady was.    Please click here to read more.

Built in 1770 by Reverend William Emerson, the house was relatively new when, on the morning of April 19, 1775, British redcoats marched past it and across the famous North Bridge on their way to Colonel Barrett's farm. The British soldiers were looking to destroy colonial militia arms caches. The first official military conflict of the American Revolution erupted about a half a mile away from the Old Manse on the North Bridge. The bridge can be seen from the house's top floors."""

I had first hiked to Lake Helene about 5 years prior on a crisp fall day and on that visit became one of my favorite locations in Rocky Mountain National Park.  I took another opportunity to visit this scenic location, this time in the summer.  As the sun rose, Notchtop glowed with a brilliant warmth similar to what I had witnessed on the prior visit.  This year, however, the water was calm and reflected the beautiful scene that was before me. - Rocky Mountain NP Photography

Bodega Bay  It was nearly a year ago when we started planning to create a Hitchcock inspired series in Devon, England.  This photograph is a play on the Hitchcock masterpiece - The Birds. The photograph places British models David Gandy and Bella di Lorenzo in a banged-up 1961 Sunbeam Rapier with the Atlantic Ocean as the backdrop. I know the area well and the image was easy to preconceive, but damn hard to capture.  The topography of the coast here in Devon is not dissimilar to the film location of Bodega Bay in northern California and I found a road location that would work well with the morning light. I wanted a big sky and a layered narrative, so I knew long before we shot that I would be working with a wide-angle lens from the car bonnet, with limited depth of field. I rather liked the fencing behind as well - so reminiscent of the opening scene in Jaws - 2 iconic horror films rolled into one.  David is a total professional and Bella is an intelligent young star who can assume a role quickly, so the problem was always going to be the gull. They are not shy in this part of the world and regularly dive-bomb our dog. But getting seagulls to dive - in the way they did with Tippi Hedren in the movie - was a challenge, especially in a limited time period.  The eye to eye contact is bang on - better than we could have hoped for and I think everyone did a very solid job.

Introducing 9A, a one-of-a-kind home boasting all four exposures, this bespoke residence has been completely redesigned by Jeffrey Beers, offering the highest quality of design, scale and architecture.

Although not directly based on the classic Humphrey Bogart film, there is definitely something to this piece that makes you think of the famous film Casablanca. It must be the combination of old-timer cars with an airplane that certainly looks as though it swooped in from yesteryear. Bringing these things together for a single acryl on canvas piece, it isn't difficult to be pulled in by the mystery of a fine art example such as this. As we move deeper and deeper into what this piece really means to us, we can find ourselves moving into another era. Available as t-shirts, wall art, or interior décor products. .<br />
